## What feature were you trying to use?

Explain the problem you were trying to solve. Note: if something _was_ documented clearly but didn't work as expected, you may want to [file a bug report](https://github.com/slinkity/slinkity/issues/new?assignees=&labels=🐞+bug&template=---report-a-bug.md&title=) instead!

## Where did our docs fail you?

[Link to the piece of documentation you found confusing, if applicable](https://slinkity.dev/docs/[PAGE])

## How can we improve?

Describe any changes to the docs you would like to see, or entirely new pages we can add.
